Live choropleth map of COVID cases in Texas with contact probabilities

Be sure to install plotly before running the script:
pip install plotly

Forecasted case numbers have been very crudely calculated - please don't use this as a resource to make decisions that may impact your health!
This project was simply meant to give an insight into the risks involved during the COVID pandemic.
